# Twist Solid

## GMS560 gene panel
The GMS560 gene panel is a combined gDNA target capture panel and a cDNA junction capture panel for comprehensive genomic profiling of solid tumors, designed and validated as a collaborative effort within the Genomic Medicine Sweden Solid tumor work package. The design allows for clinical use as well as for research applications.

## Pipeline
The Twist Solid analyses tumor-only FFPE samples and reports small variant, CNVs, fusions and biomarkers (TMB, MSI, HRD) as well as a QC report.
The pipeline is build using the (hydra-genetics)[https://github.com/hydra-genetics/hydra-genetics] framework. All new releases are run through real data sets and compared to previous versions to ensure that the expected result are generated.
